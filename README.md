# Inconsistent Expo CLI Metro Bundler Failure on Physical Device

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI where the Metro bundler intermittently fails to start when deploying to a physical device. The development server does not launch, and error messages lack specificity.

## Bug Description

The issue is characterized by the Metro bundler's unpredictable failure to initialize during the development server startup process, specifically when targeting a physical device. The emulator works without problems. Error messages provided by the Expo CLI are often insufficient for debugging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app on a physical device using Expo Go: `expo start --ios` or `expo start --android`
4. Observe that sometimes the Metro bundler fails to start without useful error messages.

## Solution

The solution might involve cleaning the project, checking for conflicting packages, updating Expo CLI and related dependencies or checking the device's network connectivity and permissions.
